# Temporal Variability of Sensitivity Coefficients in Emerging Local Electricity Markets

This project analyzes the temporal variability of sensitivity coefficients in active distribution networks and their application in local flexibility markets. Sensitivity coefficients quantify how power injections or withdrawals affect key variables such as voltage and line currents. Identifying their temporal patterns allows operators and market participants to optimize operational strategies using statistical tools and artificial intelligence.

The provided code processes hourly sensitivity matrices and generates visualizations (boxplots, daily trends, heatmaps, and correlation matrices) to highlight this variability.

## Project Structure

- `analisisdatos.ipynb`: Main script for loading sensitivity data, processing it, and generating plots.
- `SensitivityMatrixResults/`: Expected folder containing the hourly sensitivity matrices (not included in this repository).
- `SensitivityAnalysis/`: Folder where output plots will be saved.
